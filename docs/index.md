# Introduction

The Leapt Im bundle is a bundle used as general wrapper to access imagemagick command line functions, instead of
using bindings like iMagick, which does not cover all the imagemagick functionalities.

It allows you to use all the convert/mogrify power, from your controllers, services or templates.
