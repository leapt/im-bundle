# Introduction

Imagemagick wrapper for Symfony.

It's a general wrapper to access imagemagick command line functions, instead of using bindings like iMagick, 
which doesn't cover all the imagemagick functionalities.

It allows you to use all the convert/mogrify power, from your controller or your views

See the [Documentation and examples](https://github.com/leapt/im-bundle/tree/master/docs)
